## How to Create an Issue

1. Go to the repository's **Issues** tab
2. Click **New Issue**
3. Choose the appropriate template
4. Fill in all required fields (marked with red asterisks)
5. Click **Submit new issue**

## What Happens Next?

Once you submit an issue:
1. It will be reviewed by the development team
2. If the description is clear enough, a Copilot coding agent can be assigned
3. The agent will implement the changes based on your requirements
4. You'll be notified when the work is complete

## Tips for Writing Good Issues

✅ **Do:**
- Be specific about what you need
- Provide examples when possible
- Fill in all required fields
- Explain why the change is needed

❌ **Don't:**
- Leave required fields blank
- Assume technical knowledge
- Combine multiple unrelated requests in one issue
- Use vague descriptions like "make it better"
